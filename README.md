# AWS-SAM-CLI-Container
The repository includes an AWS SAM CLI inside an Alpine/ Distroless container. It's possible to interact with the AWS Serverless Application Model service and use e.g. the SAM CLI inside an isolated container environment.

## Usage

Please use the following command to start the AWS SAM CLI container and execute your corresponding commands. It's necessary to adapt the used image version e.g. `ghcr.io/zpascal/aws-sam-cli-container-pip:v1.141.0` or `ghcr.io/zpascal/aws-sam-cli-container:v1.141.0`. Please also adjust the optional volume/ file or folder mounts to use it inside the AWS SAM CLI container and execute the following command: `docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/zpascal/<Image version e.g. aws-sam-cli-container-pipp or aws-sam-cli-container>:v1.141.0 sam <command> -v <optional volume mount>`.
